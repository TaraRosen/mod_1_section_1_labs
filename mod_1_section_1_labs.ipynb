    "## Introduction\n",
    "Now that we have had an introduction to the command line, have seen how to clone GitHub repos to our local machine (our computer), and have seen some common Jupyter Notebook operations, it's time to put our skills to the test! If you're unfamiliar with the concept of variables, don't worry. Just follow along with the instructions - we'll talk about variables and data types much more in the next few lessons!\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Use basic commands to navigate the command line\n",
    "* Use bash commands to create new files and folders\n",
    "* Use `git clone` to clone a repository\n",
    "* Perform cell operations within Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from the last lesson, you need to:\n",
    "1. Click on the \"GitHub\" logo in the top right of the learn.co page\n",
    "2. Fork the repository on GitHub so you have your own copy there\n",
    "3. Copy the URL of your repository\n",
    "4. Open a terminal window (terminal on a Mac, Git Bash on Windows)\n",
    "5. Make sure to activate your conda virtual environment so you have the right version of Python and all of the necessary packages. On a mac or in Git Bash on Windows, type `source activate learn-env`. (If you *have* to use the conda shell on windows, type `activate learn-env` instead).\n",
    "6. Clone (download) the files to your hard drive by typing `git clone ` and then pasting the URL of your repo you saved in step 3.\n",
    "7. Type `cd ` followed by the name of the directory you just created (running the `ls` command will show you the name of the directory you downloaded) \n",
    "7. Run the `jupyter notebook` command to start up Jupyter, and in the browser window that opens, navigate to and click on the `index.ipynb` notebook.\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "Assign the below variable `number` to the number `42` by replacing `None` with `42`."

This can alternatively be replaced with double quotes `df[\"col_name\"]`. In general, anything in quotations is a string in Python code. Occasionally, with very ill formatted column names with quotations in the names themselves, you may even need to wrap a name in triple quotes `df[\"\"\"col_name\"\"\"]` . This will rarely happen in this particular context, but it's the general pattern for dealing with messy strings.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the second way, `df.col_name`, will only work if there are no spaces within the name of the column. Similar to tab completion with the command line, this is a primary reason why programmers use dashes (-) and underscores (_) in lieu of whitespace in their variable and file names. Also note that no quotations are used when using this format. (The column names have been stored as attributes of the DataFrame object!)"

This includes the previously mentioned *strings* as well as **lists** and other iterable objects. **Series**, the columns of the pandas DataFrame, are similar to Python's built in *lists*, but also have additional *methods* built in to them that we will continue to investigate."

Rather then import the entire package however, we import only the piece we intend to use (hence the dot notation) and again alias this under the shorthand *plt*.

We will use data from the excel file, `cities.xlsx`, that has data on different cities, their populations, and their areas. Finally, we will use this information to plot and compare each city. Let's get started!\n",

Let's retrieve this data from excel using the Pandas library. Don't worry if Pandas feels unfamiliar, it will be covered in detail later. For now, just follow the provided code and get a feel for what is happening. First, read the information from the excel file as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing a location. Then, assign this list to the variable `cities`."
